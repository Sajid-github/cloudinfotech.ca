## How to Set Up Your Own Cloud Infotech Website

If you are looking to build your own cloud-based IT service website, here are the general steps for setting up a similar website:

1. **Choose a Domain**:
   - Purchase a custom domain (we used `.ca` for this project, but you can choose others like `.com`, `.info`, etc.).
   - Set up DNS records to point your domain to the hosting service.

2. **Host the Website**:
   - We used **GitHub Pages** to host the website for free. You can also opt for other hosting providers such as **Namecheap**, **Bluehost**, or **Netlify**.
   - Upload your website files (HTML, CSS, images) to your chosen hosting platform.

3. **Link the Custom Domain**:
   - For GitHub Pages, configure your repository's settings to link your custom domain (`cloudinfotech.ca`).
   - For other hosting platforms, update the DNS records through your domain registrar (like **Namecheap**) to point to your hosting provider.

4. **Enable HTTPS (Optional but Recommended)**:
   - If you're using GitHub Pages or any other platform with SSL support, enable HTTPS to ensure your website is secure.
